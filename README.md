An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in cybersecurity is a tool or software designed to monitor a network or system for suspicious activity, unauthorized access, or policy violations. It acts like a security alarm, alerting administrators to potential threats or attacks by analyzing traffic, logs, or system behavior. The goal is to detect intrusions—attempts to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system—before significant damage occurs.
